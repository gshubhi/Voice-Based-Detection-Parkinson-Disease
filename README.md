Parkinsonâ€™s Disease (PD) presents a significant challenge in early diagnosis and monitoring due to its progressive neurodegenerative nature. This study proposes a methodology for PD detection through voice analysis using the MDVR-KCL dataset, specifically designed for mobile device voice recordings. Comprehensive feature extraction is conducted using 11 distinct algorithms to capture relevant patterns from the voice data. The proposed approach explores two feature selection approaches: Manual Feature Selection (MFS) and Automated Feature Selection (AFS). These selected features are then combined with a Deep Neural Network framework for multi-classification, aimed to identify four stages of PD. The effectiveness of both MFS and AFS approaches is evaluated, comparing their respective performance metrics. Additionally, for binary classification, features are directly input into the DNN model which achieves accuracy of 94.2%. AFS, employing the Crow Search Algorithm, achieves a notable accuracy of 90.81%, while MFS attains its best result of 91.29% using MFCC feature set for Read (RD) dataset. Additionally, using all features, the DNN achieves 91.5% accuracy without feature selection in PD multi-classification. These findings underscore the potential of voice analysis for early PD detection, offering promising results for efficient diagnosis and monitoring. This research demonstrates that remarkable results can be achieved through minimal computational resources by effectively utilising a simple deep neural network instead of opting advanced algorithm.
